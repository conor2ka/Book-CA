#Chapter 3 
   
Bob and younger birds came together to plan their trip out to view this shiny object. They came up with a pretty ordinary plan to fly straight at this shiny object. They all clumped together and took off simultaneously, as if a dog or something similar was running towards them. The flock of bird’s dart towards the shimmering light coming from the horizon. As they begin to glide out the wind picks up. The swooshing of air is all they can hear as they swerve their way towards the mysterious shimmering light on the horizon.

As they battle their way through the wind, using just curiosity to fuel their motivation to fly out to this object, they clump together to try fight the wind resistance as a team. They begin to notice that the further they fly out, the glimmering light along the horizon isn’t getting any closer. An hour passes and the group is still fighting their way towards this mysterious object, they spot a big fishing boat below, there are a couple of birds already aboard, they dive down as a team and land on the mast to try and recoup some energy. 

As they begin chatting away to the birds already on the boat, they learn that the glimmering light was just in fact the horizon and the reflection from the water. The flock of birds realise their mistake and take a ride back to the beach on the boat.
